This project was developed by a team of five people in a 24-hour `hackathon` project, for the third and last round of group projects @ <Academia de Código_>'s #34_VIMDiesels && #31_stringrays, taking place by the end of the 13th week of code learning.

## The project idea
The theme of our project was randomly picked from a selection of songs. The song we ended up with was "Bad Romance", by Lady Gaga, which is about bad relationships. Although the song has a pretty heavy meaning, we decided to give it a twist and go about it the funniest way possible, in order to portray the mood we wanted to keep through the hackathon, and to give the world more reasons to laugh. We ended up creating an app that allows people to order a singing telegram on the go, kind of like those apps that bring food to our houses...But instead, we deliver live corky musical performances to help repair relationships in critical situations.

## Development
We divided the project into sprints of about 4 hours of interval. We started by reading the lyrics of the song and watching the videoclip. We then brainstormed the basic idea for the project. When the group was satisfied with the idea, we set out to build the structure of the project and map the database.
Afterwards, we split the group into two parts: backend and frontend. The frontend group began working on the project design using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap technologies. In terms of backend, we started structuring the project by creating packages and their respective classes, and started implementing their methods, with the intention of ensuring fluid database communication. Persistence tests were made using Postman software. Finally, we joined backend and frontend development together.
