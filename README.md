#
This project was developed by a team of five people in a 24-hour `hackathon` project, for the third and last round of group projects @ <Academia de Código_>'s bootcamp#29, taking place by the end of the 13th week of code learning.

## The project idea
The project began with a challenge: develop a product inspired by a song, “Bad Romance” by Lady Gaga. Bad Romance is the first single out of Gaga’s Fame Monster album. If you look back at her past works, the main message of her music is that she is willing to do anything, even sacrifice herself, to obtain fame.

## Development
We divided the project into six four-hour sprints.
